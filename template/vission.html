        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          At EduCare, we envision a world where education is the bridge to a better future for every child, regardless of their socio-economic background. We aim to break down barriers that hinder access to knowledge and opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision is not just to educate but to empower — helping students become leaders, thinkers, and problem-solvers. We strive to build a community where education sparks change and helps eradicate poverty, discrimination, and inequality.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in nurturing minds that are curious, courageous, and creative. Through inclusive and innovative learning environments, we want to shape individuals who not only succeed academically but contribute positively to the world around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long term, we envision a generation equipped with the confidence, competence, and compassion to bring sustainable development and peace to society.
