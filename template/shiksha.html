                                Childhood is said to be the best part of human life – an age where we are carefree, safe
                                and happy. But a happy childhood is not the reality for many children, who are
                                out-of-school. There are many reasons for children to drop out of school – from
                                challenging socio-economic circumstances, to lack of awareness in communities where
                                education is not seen as a priority. <br><br>

                                Going to school not only ensures a dignified future and a happy present for children,
                                but also gives them a safe space to express themselves, learn, share and grow. Children
                                who drop out often have to work as child labour, are pushed into child marriages, or
                                become victims of child trafficking. <br><br>

                                Smile Foundation, through its ‘Shiksha Na Ruke’ initiative has been helping children
                                from difficult circumstances continue their education, with the hope of a brighter
                                future and better life. At present, we are directly providing education to over 120,000
                                children in 27 states of India. <br><br>

                                Despite all the odds, these young champions have not given up and continue to dream and
                                work hard. With your support, we can fuel their dreams with accessible and quality
                                education. Join hands with us to ensure a happy and safe childhood for all!
